# MFA: TDNN with Multi-Scale Frequency-Channel Attention for Text-Independent Speaker Verification with Short Utterances

# Note: 
Due to restrictions imposed by our affiliations, we are unable to share the complete system and pre-trained models. We appreciate everyone's support and attention towards this work. As a result, we have decided to share the model script and training configuration in the hope that it will be helpful for the research community. Important: for academic research purposes only.
